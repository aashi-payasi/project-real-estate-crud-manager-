The Real Estate CRUD Manager is a Python-based console application built to manage and organize real estate property records in a simple and efficient way.
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four basic operations required for managing data in any system. This project simulates a very small real estate management system where the user can store multiple property details and perform various operations through a clean menu-driven interface.
This application allows users to add properties by entering information such as Property ID, Address, Price, and Owner Name.
Once the data is added, the program also provides options to:

View all available properties in a clear list format

Update an existing property by searching it through its Property ID

Delete a property record based on the provided ID


The entire system works in memory using Python lists and dictionaries, making it extremely beginner-friendly.
This project is perfect for learners who want to understand:

How CRUD operations work
How to build menu-driven applications
How to store and manipulate data structures in Python
How small-scale management systems function

Although simple, this project can be expanded further by adding features like saving data to files, using JSON storage, or even converting it into a web application using Flask or Django.
Overall, the Real Estate CRUD Manager provides a solid foundation for learning how real-world data management systems operate.
