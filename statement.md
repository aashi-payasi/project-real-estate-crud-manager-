PROBLEM STATEMENT:
In real estate management, handling property records such as property IDs, addresses, prices, and owner details manually can lead to data inconsistency, loss of information, and difficulty in tracking updates.
There is no lightweight tool that allows beginners or small users to manage property data quickly and accurately without using large databases or complex software.
To solve this problem, a Python-based console application is required that can:
1.Store property records digitally
2.Allow users to easily add, view, update, and delete property information
3.Provide a clean, menu-driven interface
4.Ensure data accuracy and easy retrieval
